This first commit is written for a special use case slight modification to be done to the code to usse it independently
how to use
write all the input function in one class and save it as a py file and all the users/students should import the py file
create an object of the class in the users py file for use of input
Now name all the file accordingly and write the redre program accordigly
In my case all the students should save their file as their roll numbers hence it written with the sequence of rollnumbers
the numbers are stored in the roll.txt file
